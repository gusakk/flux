// Pool of strings which will be used for string interning.
// As flux structures all data in the tables, each table row may contain a lot of duplicated strings
// (tags, measurement, e.t.c). A lot of memory is allocated for the same strings and lead flux to consume
// a lot of memory. So, to reduce amount of memory used by the flux engine, it was decided to implement a pool of strings
// to not allocate additional memory if the string already exists in the pool. So the memory for the same strings will be allocated once.
// The pool is limited by 100.000 elements, so it means that the least recently used elements from the pool
// will be removed if the pool size will be exceeded.

// to save duplicated strings.
